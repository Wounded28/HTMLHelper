<h3>Dear Alfred</h3>
<h3>This is Jon Creed from oDesk. Can you please login and read my messages<br>
Just wondering whats going on with my project as its been over a month since any work has been done<br>
oDesk has paused the contract at the moment.<br>
All I'm wanting to know is that if you're unable to or unwilling to continue work on the project, to please let me know<br>
and provide me with everything that I have paid for so that I can start a project with someone else to complete the task.</h3>
<h3>Regards,<br>Jon Creed</h3>
